# Research Areas ![The brain is an ongoing puzzle!](Images/ChatGPT%20Image%20Jan%2029,%202026,%2004_55_18%20PM.jpg){width="375"}

Our research primarily uses neuroimaging techniques to study the brain mechanisms of psychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia and psychosis generally, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in neurological disorders.

Basically we study the brain as it functions in humans, and the role it plays in making us who we are. Existing datasets hold many answers, so we analyze those as much as possible before collecting new datasets.
